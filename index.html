There was a heavy atmosphere in the brightly lit room. White concrete walls, still air, foldable metal chair and table which was split in half by a transparent barrier. and on that little chair a crystal reflecting deep blue light. just a single shard shaped like a broken piece of glass. the lock on a metal door crackled and the door was pushed open. a couple of people walked in and surrounded the chair. There was a quiet sound of something clicking and fabric rustling across the barier. a drop of dark purplish liquid fell on top of the crystal and the two people sdanding next to it scuffed away. a few moments later the crystal started sprouting with red organic mass. it kept growing and growing taking a form. as it grew it became pale, the outer layer of the mass sepereted from the rest and became hard almost ceramic. the internal now pink mass started shaping itself into distinguishable body parts of a person that would be sitting on the chair. that process caused the hard shell to fissure into many pieces making the pink internals through many wide cracks. soon after that a head grew from the top of the torso extending forwards slightly from a neck that seperated them. when the outer layer hardened on the front of the head it gined a vivid hexagonal shape which then got split into five curved rhomboids: one big at the top and four others stacked next to each other. the rest of the head began covering itself with dark petal like plates.<br>
kitra woke up. he was sitting in what appeared to be an interrogation room. moments after he processed that fact his arms were grabed from behind and locked behind his back. he was pulled back and forced aginst the chair. a blunt groan nearly escaped his mouth. kitra looked in front of him. a person was sitting across the barrier in the middle of the room. they were wearing dark official robes with a green tie. their face had a more elongated form compared to kitra's and showed an unbrarably calm and unbothered emotion. the person was clicking a pen and playing with it in their pointy fingers while reading something on a paper in front of them. they spoke in a sharp voice:<br>
- are you responsive?<br>
"what is this?" kitra tried to ask with the best of his current ability to talk. the person behind the barier did appear to be some sort of interrogator. in response to the question they simply wrote something down on the paper.<br>
- what is your full name?<br>
kitra looked to the side. he couldn't see the person who was holding him but there was another one who looked quite intimidating as they were at least twice kitra's size. kitra answered:<br>
- kitra.<br>
- full. name.<br>
- kitra ibara.<br>
the interrogator started writing down the answeres.<br>
- any other kin?<br>
- no.<br>
- work?<br>
kitra hesitated.<br>
- ibara works as an oracle.<br>
- he supplies you?<br>
- yes.<br>
the interrogator put the paper away and stood up.<br>
- we will proceed to inspect your memories through chemical decomposition of your threads.<br>
kitra couldn't believe what he just heard, he trembled in the chair. right before he thought about escaping the interrogator continuied:<br>
- to answer your question: since you were noticed in recent protests you are probably aware that they were attended by some combat mages. bacause of that we must exploit such methods of extracting information, don't worry, we will keep you alive.<br>
an unimaginable wave of relief spread over kitra's entire body.<br>
- however, if we find that you are assosiated with any of those mages or took a part in those events your survival will not be guaranteed.<br>
they looked right at kitra and stepped a little closer.<br>
- or if a single word about this is spilled from your mouth.<br>
suddenly kitra was grabbed by his head and pushed down into the table. the facial panels dug into his flesh. he felt as a pair of cold metal scizors touched the back of his neck. with each cut he felt as the reality was slipping away from his mind. kitra's body became numb one limb at a time and shortly after he lost consciousness.<br>
---<br>
a patch of wet cold soil felt soft and almost welcoming. laying flat kitra struggled to bring himself to leave this unexpected comfort of thick blades of grass hugging him. his head felt as if it was pierced by many tiny needles and his whole body felt incredibly unfamiliar. kitra opened his panels just slightly to see that he was under open night sky. all kinds of celestial bodies shined down at him and towering black shadows around made him realise he is in a forest. kitra also suddenly realised that he is in fact wearing his clothing: an old gray shirt with buttons made of a soft fabric and a pair of uncomfortably rough black blue pants.<br>
a bright flash appeared somewhere in the distance and shined through kitra's now closed panels. immediate shock of concern shook his whole body and made him jump into a standing position almost instantly. the source of the flash made his bottom facial panels drop from fear and concern.<br>
the city just across a field looked like it was blooming. one of the tallest buildings near the border was completely engulfed in flames. "ibara.." unintentionaly left kitra's mouth. without a slightest hesitation he launched in the direction of the city. as he ran the tall trees quickly changed to field of tall grass that strongly resisted kitra's movement. debree on the dround grinded and scratched his legs
