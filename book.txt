[i've been dreading to write this book for an insanely long time. for two or three years i was simply not expressing anything. but now, when i'm sitting in front of my computer on an absolutely random moment i understand that it does not matter if my knowledge of english is too poor, or if i make mistakes during writing. i wanted my creation to live and for it to live it doesn't need to be perfect, it needs to exist.]
[chapter 1, uncontroled chemicals: only a quiet hum could be heard from the shore, kitra was sitting on a hill with his legs crossed. between him and the sea was a seemingly small town made from stone. its light was warm and seemed welcoming, a few people were rushing around it gathering some things and some others stood steadily around thick smooth walls. the houses stood low, especially for a shore city. kitra knew: these buildings aren't as petty as they look, each house goes at least twise its own height below the ground and not a single unregistered drop of water could get into there from the sea. but he also knew that he was already out of his luck and would never be able to experience the comfort of those structures again, there is no place for him, he lost everything and since he couldn't give them anything of his they would never give him anything of theirs.
